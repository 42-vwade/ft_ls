so today (9/26/2019) we had a guest speaker at 1PM
women in tech week
everybody get excited
our interviewee was a woman who has been involved in tech for more than 30 years
she has worked as CTO for various companies and has an expressed interest in AI development and education

take aways
what is bias? do we really impose personal beliefs into scientific inquiry? REAL SHIT
employers seek personality above prerequisites. this seems like one needs the prerequisites AND the personality to match.
granted, one asipring to learn might make a better impression than one who already knows (but then how is it profitable to train up?)
such is the nature of things.
domain knowledge. industry-specific experience, skills, and information.
such as farming, aerodynamics, or electrical engineering.
there exists a chasm between tech and domain knowledge.
efforts are made to bridge languages relevant to specific industries. differences such as computer science and material science.
AI plays an important role in understanding how things work, and help to make predictions about how things might work in the future.
there exists no such technology which can fully implement AGI

take opportunities. don't refuse.
challenges facing tech. communication barriers between industries.
be adaptable.

tl;dr
communicate. adapt. opportunism. (K selective)
